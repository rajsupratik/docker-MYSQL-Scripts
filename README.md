# Dockerized MySQL Utility Scripts

## Motivation

Docker is awesome! However, working with MySQL in a Dockerized environment can involve complex commands with many options and arguments. These utility scripts simplify the process by providing easy-to-use commands for common MySQL tasks.

**Note**: These scripts use the official MySQL Docker image available at [MySQL Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/mysql/).
